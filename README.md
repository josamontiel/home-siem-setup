# Home SIEM

In an effort to gain a deeper understanding of SOC infrastructure, I decided to set up a simple SIEM. This has been done using a Raspberry Pi, some virtual machines (using virtual box) and Wazuh. As described on their site "Wazuh is a free and open source security platform that unifies XDR and SIEM capabilities. It protects workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments." This means i was able to deploy all of this for the free!!

### Tools Used:
1. [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/)
2. [Virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
3. [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)

The Raspberry pi I walready had and just used RaspberryPi OS. So I technically did not have to purchase anyhting for this project. The Pi was used as the Wazuh Server as I had a 256gb SD card so storage will not be an issue. I'm limited in how many VMs i can run at once as my laptop only has 8GB :(.
